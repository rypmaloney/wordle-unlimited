# Wordle Unlimited

This is a simple wordle clone using CRA and tailwind. I used HeadlessUI for toggle and modal components. 

This was my first time using tailwind on a full project and I was really impressed with a) how much faster it is to get something up and running and b) how easy it is to make something simple and responsive for mobile.
